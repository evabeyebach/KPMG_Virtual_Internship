# KPMG_Virtual_Internship
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to help gain a practical insight into the work they do at KPMG and it is an opportunity for us to build our career skills and experience. It consists of three different tasks (Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights and Presentation). They want to know which customers to target (out of the New Customer List) in order to improve their business.

## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The client has provided KPMG with 4 different datasets (Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, Transactions and New Customer List).

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
- Data Quality Analysis
- Analytical Dashboard Creation  
- Drafting an email to the client, identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.

## Task 2: Data Insights
### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes from NewCustomer List
To build this recommendation, first start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach to take and focuse on three different Phases: Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation. All this by implementing: 
- Data Analytics
- Customer Segmentation

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
### Using visualizations to present insights
Develop a dashboard using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Specifically, the presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list.
